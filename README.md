<h1><strong>Data science porfolio by Taylor Kravits</strong></h1>

This is a portfolio of various data science and GIS projects. Many of these projects were developed to clean, analyze, and present property data but there are personal projects related to outdoor adventures and the financial sector as well.

<h2> Data Science Projects </h2>

<h3> Building Permit Data Clean Up and Automation </h3>

This tool allows the user to select an excel sheet from which to import given permit information. Many municipalities in Boulder County either hand enter or have extraneous data which leads to errors. The script then makes the necessary changes to the data and reformats the information.

The result it three output files: an excel sheet with the permits are being reviewed, a text file in the correct format to be pulled into a CAMA database, and an excel sheet summarizing the information for the appraisers.

<h3> Housing Sale Analysis </h3>

This project to pull the PDFs from the MLS database and see if residential housing prices are being affected by the Coronavirus pandemic. This code reads the MLS PDFs and pulls the sold price, and any concessions (if there are any), then compares it as a percentage, and produces a <a href="https://github.com/tkravits/MLS_PDFproject/blob/master/Figure_1.png">chart</a>.

This is a work in progress
