This is a portfolio of various data science and GIS projects. Many of these projects were developed to clean, analyze, and present property data but there are personal projects related to outdoor adventures and the financial sector as well.

<h3> Permit Data Clean Up and Automation </h3>

This tool allows the user to select an excel sheet from which to import given permit information. Many municipalities in Boulder County either hand enter or have extraneous data which leads to errors. The script then makes the necessary changes to the data and reformats the information.

The result it three output files: an excel sheet with the permits are being reviewed, a text file in the correct format to be pulled into a CAMA database, and an excel sheet summarizing the information for the appraisers. The code is found <a href="https://github.com/tkravits/Building-Permit-Automation">here</a>
