This ArcPy code is designed to select a field within a layer and zoom to it in ArcGIS Desktop. It was developed using ArcMap 10.5. This code also assumes the individual knows how to create a toolbox in ArcGIS. If help is needed to create a toolbox see:
 <https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/managing-tools-and-toolboxes/creating-a-custom-toolbox.htm>

The user will set up ahead of time what field is to be selected. Once the toolbox is opened, it will ask for the user input for the field. Example is given below:<br>
