The Assessor's office is responsible for maintaining accurate valuations and property attributes for the jurisdictions in which they serve. Building permits fall into this category and allow the appraisal staff to see if there are big changes occurring to the property that could affect the value.

This code allows the user to select an excel sheet from which to import given permit information. Many municipalities in Boulder County either hand enter or have extraneous data which leads to errors. The script reformats the data, searches for the correct property using the address or parcel number, and attaches the tax id so that the building permit can be uploaded into our database.

<b>Methods</b><br>
This is a portion of the original dataset:

|PermitNum |	Description |	AppliedDate |	IssuedDate |	 StatusCurrent	| OriginalAddress	|OriginalCity	|OriginalState	|OriginalZip	|PIN	|PermitType|	PermitWorkType	|EstProjectCost |

The biggest accomplishments of this code is classifying the type of permit (SCOPE) into a preset code (ex: Roofing permits are classified as RRR), attaching the correct tax ID (strap) using the address and if the address is not found in our system, using the parcel number.

The result it three output files: an text and excel sheet with the permits are issued for the appraisers to use to review permits:
