This is my data science portfolio. You can find a variety of projects ranging from data clean up, analysis, and visualization. I also have a variety of side projects which involve mapping my outdoor activities on Strava, predicting stock price movement, and my foray into learning Java.

In my spare time you can find me mountain biking, running, backcountry skiing, backpacking, and fly fishing.

My resume, email, and social media links are below. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
